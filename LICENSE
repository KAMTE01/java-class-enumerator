I deduced this from http://meta.stackexchange.com/questions/25956/what-is-up-with-the-source-code-license-on-stack-overflow

Further, whatever rights I have accidentally retained unto my own person, I forfeit under the [WTFPL](http://www.wtfpl.net/about/) to the extent that is compatible with the primary license and does not contradict the primary license. Or whatever. :)
